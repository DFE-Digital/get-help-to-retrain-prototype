        <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to discover your skills, explore jobs you could do and check training courses that will help you find a better job.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why you need to retrain</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Even if you’re already employed, some training – for example, a free short course in maths or English – will improve your chances of getting a more stable, higher paid job, and it means you’ll be less likely to lose your job in the future.</p>

            <div class="govuk-inset-text">You’ll get personalised advice and support along the way, so you can find training that fits around your schedule and personal needs – for example, with childcare or IT skills, or if you have not studied in a while and feel unsure.</div>
